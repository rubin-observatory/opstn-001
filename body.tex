\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

We are currently experimenting with Google and Amazon services for science platform and processing.
These services are priced to deliver compute and storage - our current model at the \gls{LDF} is also service oriented but
is not proceed in the same manner making comparisons difficult. It has been difficult to get an alternative cost model
together. An initial approach to a \gls{cloud} costing was outlined in \citeds{DMTN-072}, this approach was to try to cost the hardware and compare to \gls{cloud} pricing.

In this document a radical restructuring of \gls{LSST} operations is explored - a technology stack underpinned by commodity services which could be provided by commercial providers or computing centers. Here we look first at how we would run something like this -we can then leave one free variable which is the cost of the underlying compute and storage services. This will both help to
sanity check the \gls{LDF} costing and potentially allow us to have a ball park for assessing commodity provider offers.

Notably missing from \figref{fig:sciopsorg} is \gls{QA}. Currently \gls{QA} is spread across  three
 departments - the suggestion here is to place all \gls{QA} activities under the survey performance department. Consolidation
of the \gls{QA} activities in one department may allow for some personnel saving.

The data release team in science operations would require a verification scientist (this may be 0.5FTE) while the \gls{SDQA} and Semantic scientists may move to QA in survey science.

All data facility work, be it with a partner or in commercial \gls{cloud} should be firmly under science operations - hence there is no LDF department and no associate director for LDF as depicted in \figref{fig:opsorg}.\footnote{This is  in line with AMCL recommendations}

\textbf{NOTE: I have said before communications should report directly to the director - in \figref{fig:opsorg} there is NO communications.}

ITC and facilities (\figref{fig:opsorg}) in this model should come from NCOA  logically also this does not belong in data production but at a higher level its for the entire org, the observatory already has its own ITC group so they are good.


There are still some developments in NCSA such as DAQ forwarders which would need to be included in possibly the observatory software.

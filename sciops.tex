\section{Data Production Department }\label{sec:sciops} \label{sec:dataprod}

The role of data production within \gls{LSST} is to deliver \gls{LSST}'s science products: the science images, the alert stream, the annual data releases, the science \gls{software}, and the Science Platform. In the current ops proposal not all groups required to do this are under control of Science operations.

\figref{fig:org} gives a view of the Data Production teams which combine some of the old science operations  and LDF departments. This is far more analogous to Data Management moving into operations than in the current proposal and would make for a smoother transition.

\subsection{Other implied changes to the current operations proposal}
Notably missing from \figref{fig:sciopsorg} is \gls{QA}. Currently \gls{QA} is spread across  three
 departments - the suggestion here is to place all \gls{QA} activities under the survey performance department. Consolidation
of the \gls{QA} activities in one department may allow for some personnel saving.

The data release team in science operations would require a verification scientist (this may be 0.5FTE) while the \gls{SDQA} and Semantic scientists may move to QA in survey science.

All data facility work, be it with a partner or in commercial \gls{cloud} should be firmly under science operations - hence there is no LDF department and no associate director for LDF as depicted in \figref{fig:opsorg}.\footnote{This is  in line with AMCL recommendations}

\textbf{NOTE:} I have said before communications should report directly to the director - in \figref{fig:opsorg} there is NO communications.

ITC and facilities (\figref{fig:opsorg}) in this model should come from NCOA  logically also this does not belong in data production but at a higher level its for the entire org, the observatory already has its own ITC group so they are good.

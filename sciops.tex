\section{Data Production Department }\label{sec:sciops} \label{sec:dataprod}

The role of data production within \gls{LSST} is to deliver \gls{LSST}'s science products: the science images, the alert stream, the annual data releases, the science \gls{software}, and the Science Platform. In the current ops proposal not all groups required to do this are under control of Science operations.

\figref{fig:opsorg} gives a view of the Data Production teams which combine some of the old science operations  and \gls{LDF} departments. This is far more analogous to Data Management moving into operations than in the current proposal and would make for a smoother transition.

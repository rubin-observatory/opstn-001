\section{Data Production Department }\label{sec:sciops} \label{sec:dataprod}

The role of data production within \gls{LSST} is to deliver \gls{LSST}'s science products: the science images, the alert stream, the annual data releases, the science \gls{software}, and the Science Platform. In the current ops proposal not all groups required to do this are under control of the  science operations \gls{AD}.

\figref{fig:opsorg} gives a view of the Data Production teams which combine some of the old science operations  and \gls{LDF} departments. This is far more analogous to Data Management moving into operations than in the current proposal and would make for a smoother transition.

The \gls{FTE} counts are estimated in \tabref{tab:FTE}, which also gives the team sizes form the operations proposal for comparison.
A brief description of the teams is given in \secref{sec:teams}.

{\bf Note:} The numbers in \tabref{tab:FTE} assume we choose the people in the roles based on experience and effectiveness - in the current plan there are a number of \gls{DOE} provided FTEs where the reason in some case seems to be availability rather than suitability. In the submitted proposal there was probably a certain number of duplicated roles (certainly in \gls{LDF}) to cover this. We must consider this aspect carefully.

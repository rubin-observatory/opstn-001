 Schema: - Niall Gaffney -The definition of the metadata and linkages between datasets and metadata entities in a collection of data or archive
Value Added:A catalog or data product generated by the science community, based on datasets output by surveys or archives. Ideally will be integrated into data archive so it can be shared within the community.
TPU: Tensor Processing Unit , a proprietary type of processor designed by Google in 2016 for use with neural networks and in machine learning projects
open source software:Open source software is a type of software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Note that this is \emph{not} necessarily the same as open to contribution (see \gls{open development}).
open development:A process for developing software that emphasizes all code contribution and decision-making be done in the open, available to as wide a group as possible (This usually means anyone with internet access).
ODBC: Open DataBase Connectivity, a standard \gls{API} for \gls{SQL} databases. 
version control:The management of changes to documents, computer programs, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and merged
git:The most widely used \gls{DVCS} software
MCMC: Markov Chain Monte Carlo, a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution.
P5:The Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel is a scientific advisory panel tasked with recommending prioritization for U.S. investment in particle physics research, on the basis of various funding scenarios.  The last full report was in 2014: \url{https://www.usparticlephysics.org/resources/}.
Authentication:The action of showing who you are and an person, mission, or other entity
Authorization:The action of allowing an authorized or anonymous entity access to data or services
cyberinfrastructure :Sometimes denoted CI, A term first used by the US National Science Foundation (\gls{NSF}), and it typically is used to refer to information technology systems that provide particularly powerful and advanced capabilities. 
reproducibility:(this one should have many definitions and we have to say WHICH version we are talking about) The ability to combine the same code and data and get the same result, or the ability to use the same code with different data to enforce a result, or there may be others
interoperability :the ability of systems or software to exchange and make use of information between them.

Commodity Computing:Computing bought off the shelf not specific for astronomy, could be infrastructure as a service (\gls{ias}) bough from a cloud vendor.
valley of death:Most startups fail within three years. Funding is easier in year one and profitability often takes four years, if they get past that they are out of the valley of death. Many technology problems face a similar adoption problem
IAM:Identity and Access Management
NSF:National Science Foundation
IaS:Infrastructure as a Service
parquet:Parquet File Format Hadoop. Parquet, an open source file format for Hadoop. Parquet stores nested data structures in a flat columnar format. Compared to a traditional approach where data is stored in row-oriented approach, parquet is more efficient in terms of storage and performance.
software:  The programs and other operating information used by a computer.
SQL:Structured Query Language, for interrogating relation databases
community software: Software developed for and shared among a large group of relatively like-minded users (e.g. astronomers). Typically, but not necessarily, \gls{open source software} and \gls{open development}-based.
Docker: A popular implementation of \gls{container} technology.
container: A container is a software package that contains everything the software needs to run. This includes the executable program as well as system tools, libraries, and settings. ... For example, a container that includes PHP and MySQL can run identically on both a Linux computer and a Windows machine.

\subsection{Service budget}

If we assume we do not reduce the operations budget then the total cost of the \gls{LDF} services is
the difference in \gls{FTE} and the non labor costs for computer purchases.
This is calculated in \tabref{tab:Services}. One must also bear in mind that the data volume etc. increases each year,
initial costs could be a little lower with final costs being a little higher. Service prices though are dropping every year so do we add significant data each year our costs should not in crease by the same fraction.

\input{Services}


We would still require some hardware on the mountain and the base in Chile where we would potentially still keep a copy of the raw data.

The  \gls{LSST} data volumes are in  \tabref{tab:sizes}.

The compute estimates are a little more difficult to extract in \tabref{tab:Inputs} from \citeds{DMTN-072}
an estimate is made in terms of FLOPs.

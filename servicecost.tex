\subsection{Service budget}

If we assume we do not reduce the operations budget then the total cost of the \gls{LDF} services is
the difference in \gls{FTE} and the non labor costs for computer purchases.
This is calculated in \tabref{tab:Services} .

\input{Services}

\textbf{ These non labor numbers need to come out of the proposal sheets - I only had a \gls{PDF} and did not try to do this properly. It should exclude the BASE hardware and Chilean archive hardware budgets.}


We would still require some hardware on the mountain and the base in Chile where we would potentially still keep a copy of the raw data.


The  LSST data volumes are in  \tabref{tad:sizes}.

\input{images/sizetab}



The compute estimates are a little more difficult to extract in \tabref{tab:Inputs} from \citeds{DMTN-072}
an estimate is made in terms of FLOPs.

\subsection{Service budget}

If we assume we do not reduce the operations budget then the total cost of the \gls{LDF} services is
the difference in \gls{FTE} and the non labor costs for computer purchases.
This is calcualted in \tabref{tab:Services} .

\input{Services}

\textbf{ These non labor numbers need to coem out of the proposal sheets - I only had a \gls{PDF} and di not try to do this properly. It should exclude the BASE hardware and Chilean archive hardware budgets.}


We would still require some hardware on the moutain and the base in Chile where we would potentially still keep a copy of the raw data.
